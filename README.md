Prediction House Price Using Image Processing
==============================

When you are searching for a house the first things that catch your eyes are the house's images posted along with other information. Predicting house prices has always been one of the interesting projects for most data scientists. There are many features that are found to be correlated with house price and lots of approaches and models to address this problem. So far most of these approaches are using house general features like total house sq, total lot sq, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, kitchen sq, school zone, street address, state, zip code and others to predict price but there are a few models trying to use features from images. In this capstone I am trying to fill this gap to see if there is a better prediction for house price using images.
